# diabetes_prediction
a simple exercice to practice KNN algorithm in the prediction of whether a person will have diabete or not

K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the simplest supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification. It classifies a data point based on its neighbors’ classifications. It stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on similar features. 

The KNN algorithm is used in the following scenarios:
✅Data is labeled
✅Data is noise-free
✅Dataset is small, as KNN is a lazy learner

the KNN is a type of instance_based algorithm which rely on the measure of similarity
